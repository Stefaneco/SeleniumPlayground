## Important repository status update
When first creating this repository I've had a few personal projects done using Selenium under my belt. That being said, I'm still developing and looking back at this project there are many things I would do different today.
Provided solutions are still good and sound - so if you're at the beggining of your automation journey it's a good starting point!
As for me I'll be creating simillar project in the near future - I'll link it here later. Things that will change:
- **C#** will replace **Java**
- **Playwright** will replace **Selenium**
- Use of Design Patterns such as **Page Object Pattern**

If you're interested what motivated me to change my approach:
### C# over Java, Playwright over Selenium
When I've started this project I was under impression that vast majority of test automation is done in Java. It turns out the automation world isn't as polarized as I thoght. Same stands true for Selenium. I've much more experience in C# developement and it seems like a more friendly and easy to use language. It seems that the world of automation is slowly moving away from selenium in favor of other, better mantained solutions. 
You can find a few exercises in this repository that I've had trouble solving with selenium. Some features seem to be broken for years and developers have to use weird work arounds. That's why I want to give Playwright a try.

### Design Patterns and my new found love for automation
When working on my Android projects I've always enjoyed improving on my apps architecture. I've countless hours researching Clean Architecture, MVVM and Design Patterns used in software developement. Somehow however I've not transfered that knowladge to my Automation Projects. For a long time I was thinking about testing as more of a scripting task than a design task. It is only after I've landed my first internship as test automation engineer that I've fully understood that my two passions for Software Design and Scripting go hand in hand in the world of test automation. I'll be always grateful to my two great mentors Grzegorz and Micha≈Ç that helped me to realise that, and to my collegues Jacek and Jagoda that I have pleasure to learn along.

As for the project - All those reasons and the amount of changes I would like to make pushed me to a decision to restart the project. I want my automation projects to be well designed, not only well scripted. I'm not deleting this one tho, as it is a good testiment of my journey, and maybe if you've stumbeled upon it you can extract some value out of provided scripts. 

And now - without further ado - please enjoy the original readme:

# SeleniumPlayground

Welcome to my SeleniumPlayground! This repository is a testament to my journey in learning Selenium, and serves as a platform for showcasing my solutions to different test automation practice exercises. It also demonstrates the various capabilities of Selenium.

While the solutions provided are my own, I believe that there are multiple ways to approach these exercises. I welcome any alternative solutions, questions, or general feedback you may have. Feel free to open an issue to start a discussion.


## Websites

Currently, this repository contains solutions for exercises from the following websites:

- [Itera-qa](https://itera-qa.azurewebsites.net/home/practice)
- [UiTestingPlayground](http://www.uitestingplayground.com)
- [The Internet](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) (In progress)

In the near future, I plan to explore and add solutions for exercises from these websites:

- [globalsqa](https://www.globalsqa.com/demo-site/)

## Contributions

Your suggestions and contributions are always welcome! If you know of any good sites that offer QA or automation exercises, or if you have any general suggestions, don't hesitate to let me know. 

## Acknowledgements 

Thank you to all the awsome creators that provide these exercises, making it possible for people like me to learn, practice, and improve automation skills.
