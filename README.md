Welcome to my SeleniumPlayground! This repository is a testament to my journey in learning Selenium, and serves as a platform for showcasing my solutions to different test automation practice exercises. It also demonstrates the various capabilities of Selenium.

While the solutions provided are my own, I believe that there are multiple ways to approach these exercises. I welcome any alternative solutions, questions, or general feedback you may have. Feel free to open an issue to start a discussion.

## Websites

Currently, this repository contains solutions for exercises from the following websites:

- [Itera-qa](https://itera-qa.azurewebsites.net/home/practice)

In the near future, I plan to explore and add solutions for exercises from these websites:

- [globalsqa](https://www.globalsqa.com/demo-site/)
